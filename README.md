How to get started:

-Pull master
-Navigate CLI to root folder
-command 'npm install' to get node-modules
-command 'npm start' to start an instance locally


Conventions:

CSS:
    Class naming: 'componentname-classname' this will avoid having the same name across .css files 
        
    All compontent css should go in the associated component file
    All animations should go in App.css 

    Elements on the body of the page should be centered at 80% at full screen

    Sections should have a vertical margin of 8% 
    Anything nested in the section should have a vertical margin of 5%


JSX:
    Pascel case .jsx files
    Inside folder with the same name and css file
    
    Example JSX object: 
    
        export const ActionButton = (props) => {}


Javascript:
    Just follow best practices otherwise have at it, it's javascript
