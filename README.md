How to get started:

-Pull master
-Navigate CLI to root folder
-Run npm install to get node-modules


Conventions:

CSS:
    Class naming: 'ComponentNamePascalCase-ClassName' this will avoid having the same name across .css files 
        
    All compontent css should go in the associated component file
    All animations should go in App.css 

JSX:
    Pascel case .jsx files
    Inside folder with the same name and css file
    Example JSX object: 
    
        export const ActionButton = (props) => {}


Javascript:
    Just follow best practices otherwise have at it it's javascript
